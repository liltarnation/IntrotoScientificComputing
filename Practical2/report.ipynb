The difference in the later Epochs 7-9 starts to get a lot smaller and less significant than the earlier ones. Since this is true, we can state that this follows a logarithmic curve.

The optimizer is the function that determines the attributes of the neural networks such as the learning rate to minimise certain errors. In this case, we are trying to minimize the loss function. The learning rate decides the amount of changes the updates take place at each training step. As we increase the inital learning rate for the epochs, we notice that through the Mini-batch SGD optimizer, this also results in an increase in the speed of convolution of the Epochs at each iteration. However, if we increase the initial learning rate by too much, this causes too drastic updates, and results in divergent behaviour. Also, if we decrease the initial learning rate by too much, the program would take ages to finish. \n","\n","4.
